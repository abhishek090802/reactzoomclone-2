// This is a React functional component named MeetingMaximumUsersField. It uses Elastic UI (EUI) components to render a form row with a numeric input field for setting the maximum number of people allowed in a meeting. The component receives two props:

// value: It is a number representing the currently set maximum number of people for the meeting.
// setSize: It is a React state updater function used to set the maximum number of people. This function is called when the numeric input value changes.

// Let's understand the component:

// The component imports the necessary dependencies:

import { EuiFieldNumber, EuiFormRow } from "@elastic/eui";
import React from "react";
// EuiFieldNumber and EuiFormRow are components from the Elastic UI library (@elastic/eui).
// React is imported to use JSX and create React components.

// The MeetingMaximumUsersField function is defined, taking an object as a parameter that contains two properties:

function MeetingMaximumUsersField({
  value,
  setSize,
}: {
  value: number;
  setSize: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<number>>;
})
// value: A number representing the currently set maximum number of people for the meeting.
  
// setSize: A React state updater function that is used to set the maximum number of people. It takes a new number as an argument.

{

  // Inside the component, the EuiFormRow component is used to create a form row with a label "Maximum People". This label appears above the numeric input field.

// The EuiFieldNumber component is used to render the actual numeric input field. It receives several props:

  return (
    <EuiFormRow label="Maximum People">
      <EuiFieldNumber
        min={1}
        max={50}
        placeholder="Maximum People"
        value={value}
        // min: It sets the minimum allowed value for the numeric input to 1.
// max: It sets the maximum allowed value for the numeric input to 50.
// placeholder: It provides a placeholder text that appears inside the numeric input field when it is empty.
// value: It takes the value prop, which represents the currently set maximum number of people for the meeting. The numeric input field will display this value.

        onChange={(e) => {
          if (!e.target.value.length || parseInt(e.target.value) === 0)
            setSize(1);
          else if (parseInt(e.target.value) > 50) setSize(50);
          else setSize(parseInt(e.target.value));
        }}
      />
    </EuiFormRow>
  );
}

// onChange: It takes a function that is called when the user changes the numeric input value. The provided function receives an event object (e) containing the new input value. The component then checks the input value and updates the maximum number of people using the setSize function accordingly.

// The onChange event handler checks the input value and performs the following actions:
// If the input value is empty or 0, it sets the maximum number of people to 1.
// If the input value is greater than 50, it sets the maximum number of people to 50.
// For all other valid input values, it sets the maximum number of people to the parsed integer value of the input.


export default MeetingMaximumUsersField;

// Overall, this component provides a reusable numeric input field for setting the maximum number of people allowed in a meeting. It integrates with the Elastic UI library to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface for managing the maximum number of users in React applications.
