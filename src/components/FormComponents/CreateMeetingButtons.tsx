// This is a React functional component named CreateMeetingButtons. It renders two Elastic UI (EUI) buttons inside a FlexGroup layout. The component is designed to handle creating or editing a meeting and includes a "Cancel" button and a "Create Meeting" or "Edit Meeting" button based on the isEdit prop.

import { EuiButton, EuiFlexGroup, EuiFlexItem } from "@elastic/eui";
// EuiButton, EuiFlexGroup, and EuiFlexItem are components from the Elastic UI library (@elastic/eui).

import React from "react";
// React is imported to use JSX and create React components.

import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
// useNavigate is imported from "react-router-dom" to enable programmatic navigation.

// The CreateMeetingButtons function is defined, taking an object as a parameter that contains three properties:

function CreateMeetingButtons({
  // createMeeting: A required function that should be called when the "Create Meeting" or "Edit Meeting" button is clicked.

  createMeeting,
  isEdit = false,
  closeFlyout,
}: {
  createMeeting: () => {};
  isEdit?: boolean;
  closeFlyout?: () => {};
}) {
  // createMeeting: A required function that should be called when the "Create Meeting" or "Edit Meeting" button is clicked.
// isEdit: An optional boolean that indicates whether the component is in edit mode. By default, it is set to false.
// closeFlyout: An optional function that should be called when the "Cancel" button is clicked to close a flyout or any other UI element. It is only applicable when in edit mode (isEdit is true).

  const navigate = useNavigate();
  // Inside the component, the useNavigate hook is called to get the navigate function, which can be used to programmatically navigate to different routes.

  // The component renders the UI using the Elastic UI components:

  return (
    <EuiFlexGroup>
      <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
        <EuiButton
          color="danger"
          onClick={() => (isEdit ? closeFlyout!() : navigate("/"))}
          fill
        >
          {/* The UI is wrapped inside an EuiFlexGroup, which arranges its children in a horizontal layout by default.
Two EuiFlexItem components are used to position the buttons side by side. The grow={false} prop prevents them from taking up additional space if available.
 */}

          Cancel
        </EuiButton>
      </EuiFlexItem>
      <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
        <EuiButton type="submit" onClick={createMeeting} fill>
          {isEdit ? "Edit Meeting" : "Create Meeting"}
          {/* The first button is an EuiButton with the label "Cancel". It has the color "danger" and is styled as a filled button using the fill prop. The onClick event is attached to this button, and it contains a ternary expression to determine its behavior. If isEdit is true, it calls the closeFlyout function; otherwise, it uses the navigate function to navigate to the root ("/") route. */}

        </EuiButton>
        {/* The second button is another EuiButton with the label "Create Meeting" or "Edit Meeting" based on the value of the isEdit prop. It also has the fill prop, which makes it a filled button. The onClick event is attached to this button, and it calls the createMeeting function when clicked.
      */}

      </EuiFlexItem>
    </EuiFlexGroup>
  );
}

export default CreateMeetingButtons;

// Overall, this component is used to render buttons for creating or editing a meeting. It allows users to create a new meeting or edit an existing one and provides navigation options for cancelling the operation. The specific behavior of the buttons depends on the values of the isEdit prop and the functions passed as createMeeting and closeFlyout.
