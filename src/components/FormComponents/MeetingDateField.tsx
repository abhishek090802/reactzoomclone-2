// This is a React functional component named MeetingDateField. It uses Elastic UI (EUI) components to render a form row with a date picker for selecting a meeting date. The component receives two props:

import { EuiDatePicker, EuiFormRow } from "@elastic/eui";


import moment from "moment";
import React from "react";
// EuiDatePicker and EuiFormRow are components from the Elastic UI library (@elastic/eui).
// moment is imported to work with dates and times in JavaScript. It is used to handle the selected meeting date.
// React is imported to use JSX and create React components.


function MeetingDateField({
  selected,
  setStartDate,
  // selected: It is a moment object representing the currently selected meeting date.
// setStartDate: It is a React state updater function used to set the selected meeting date. This function is called when the date picker value changes.

// The MeetingDateField function is defined, taking an object as a parameter that contains two properties:
// selected: A moment object representing the currently selected meeting date.
// setStartDate: A React state updater function that is used to set the selected meeting date. It takes a new moment object as an argument.


}: {
  selected: moment.Moment;
  setStartDate: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<moment.Moment>>;
}) {
  return (
    <EuiFormRow label="Set Meeting Date">
      <EuiDatePicker
      //  Inside the component, the EuiFormRow component is used to create a form row with a label "Set Meeting Date". This label appears above the date picker.

// The EuiDatePicker component is used to render the actual date picker. It receives two props:

        selected={selected}
        onChange={(date) => setStartDate(date!)}
      />

      {/* selected: It takes the selected prop, which represents the currently selected date. The date picker will display this value as the initially selected date.

onChange: It takes a function that is called when the user selects a new date using the date picker. The provided function receives the new date as a parameter (a moment object), and it updates the selected date using the setStartDate function. */}

{/* When the user selects a new date from the date picker, the onChange event is triggered, and the provided function is called with the new date. The setStartDate function is then used to update the selected state with the new date. */}

    </EuiFormRow>
  );
}

export default MeetingDateField;
// Overall, this component provides a reusable date picker for selecting a meeting date. It integrates with the Elastic UI library to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface for selecting dates in React applications.
