// This is a React functional component named MeetingUserField. It uses Elastic UI (EUI) components to render a form row with a combo box for selecting users or items from a list. The component receives several props:

// label: A string representing the label of the form row.

// isInvalid: A boolean indicating whether the input is in an invalid state.

// error: An array of strings representing the error messages to display when the input is in an invalid state.

// options: An array of objects representing the available options to select from the combo box.

// onChange: A function that is called when the user selects an option from the combo box. The function receives the selected option(s) as an argument.

// selectedOptions: An array of objects representing the currently selected option(s) in the combo box.

// singleSelection: An optional boolean or object specifying whether the combo box allows single or multiple selections. By default, it is set to false, indicating multiple selections are allowed. If set to { asPlainText: true }, it allows single selection and displays the selected option as plain text (no tag-like representation).

// isClearable: A boolean indicating whether the combo box allows clearing the selected options.

// placeholder: A string providing a placeholder text that appears inside the combo box when no option is selected.


// Let's understand the component:

import { EuiComboBox, EuiFormRow } from "@elastic/eui";
import React from "react";
// EuiComboBox and EuiFormRow are components from the Elastic UI library (@elastic/eui).

// React is imported to use JSX and create React components.

// The MeetingUserField function is defined, taking an object as a parameter that contains several properties as described above.

{
  // Inside the component, the EuiFormRow component is used to create a form row with the specified label and error handling. It receives the following props:

  return (
    <EuiFormRow label={label} isInvalid={isInvalid} error={error}>
{/* label: It displays the label for the form row.

isInvalid: It takes the isInvalid prop, which determines if the input is in an invalid state. If true, the form row will show an error state.

error: It takes the error prop, which is an array of strings representing error messages. If the isInvalid prop is true, these error messages will be displayed.

{/* Inside the form row, the EuiComboBox component is used to render the actual combo box. It receives several props:
*/}

      <EuiComboBox
        options={options}
        onChange={onChange}

// options: It takes the options prop, which represents the available options to select from the combo box.

// onChange: It takes the onChange prop, which is a function called when the user selects an option from the combo box. The selected option(s) are passed as an argument to this function.

// selectedOptions: It takes the selectedOptions prop, which represents the currently selected option(s) in the combo box.

// singleSelection: It takes the singleSelection prop, which determines whether the combo box allows single or multiple selections. If set to false (default), multiple selections are allowed. If set to { asPlainText: true }, single selection is allowed, and the selected option is displayed as plain text without any tag-like representation.

// isClearable: It takes the isClearable prop, which determines whether the combo box allows clearing the selected options.

// placeholder: It provides a placeholder text that appears inside the combo box when no option is selected.

// isInvalid: It takes the isInvalid prop, which determines if the input is in an invalid state. If true, the combo box will show an error state.

// When the user selects an option(s) from the combo box, the onChange event handler is triggered, and the provided function is called with the selected option(s) as an argument.

export default MeetingUserField;

// Overall, this component provides a reusable combo box for selecting users or items from a list. It integrates with the Elastic UI library to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface for managing user selections in React applications.
