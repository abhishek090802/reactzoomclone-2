// This is a React functional component named MeetingNameField. It uses Elastic UI (EUI) components to render a form row with a text input field for setting the meeting name. The component receives several props:


// label: A string representing the label of the form row.
// isInvalid: A boolean indicating whether the input is in an invalid state.

// error: An array of strings representing the error messages to display when the input is in an invalid state.

// placeholder: A string providing a placeholder text that appears inside the text input field when it is empty.

// value: A string representing the currently set meeting name.

// setMeetingName: A React state updater function used to set the meeting name. This function is called when the input value changes.

// Let's understand the component:

import { EuiFieldText, EuiFormRow } from "@elastic/eui";
import React from "react";
import ThemeSelector from "../ThemeSelector";
// The component imports the necessary dependencies:

// EuiFieldText and EuiFormRow are components from the Elastic UI library (@elastic/eui).

// React is imported to use JSX and create React components.

// ThemeSelector is imported from "../ThemeSelector", presumably a custom component used to apply a specific theme to the rendered content.

function MeetingNameField({
  label,
  isInvalid,
  error,
  placeholder,
  value,
  setMeetingName,
}: {
  label: string;
  isInvalid: boolean;
  error: Array<string>;
  placeholder: string;
  value: string;
  setMeetingName: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<string>>;
}) {
// The MeetingNameField function is defined, taking an object as a parameter that contains several properties as described above.


  return (
    <ThemeSelector>
      {/* Inside the component, the ThemeSelector component is wrapped around the form row and its content. This component may provide a custom theme or styling to the form row and its children.
       */}

      <EuiFormRow label={label} isInvalid={isInvalid} error={error}>
        {/* The EuiFormRow component is used to create a form row with the specified label and error handling. It receives the following props:

label: It displays the label for the form row.

isInvalid: It takes the isInvalid prop, which determines if the input is in an invalid state. If true, the form row will show an error state.

error: It takes the error prop, which is an array of strings representing error messages. If the isInvalid prop is true, these error messages will be displayed. */}

        <EuiFieldText
          placeholder={placeholder}
          value={value}
          onChange={(e) => setMeetingName(e.target.value)}
          isInvalid={isInvalid}
        />

        {/* Inside the form row, the EuiFieldText component is used to render the actual text input field. It receives several props:

placeholder: It provides a placeholder text that appears inside the text input field when it is empty.

value: It takes the value prop, which represents the currently set meeting name. The text input field will display this value.

onChange: It takes a function that is called when the user changes the input value. The provided function receives an event object (e) containing the new input value. The component then calls the setMeetingName function to update the meeting name with the new value.

isInvalid: It takes the isInvalid prop, which determines if the input is in an invalid state. If true, the text input field will show an error state.
 */}
      </EuiFormRow>
    </ThemeSelector>
    // When the user types in the text input field, the onChange event handler is triggered, and the provided function is called with the new input value. The setMeetingName function is then used to update the meeting name with the new value.

  );
}

export default MeetingNameField;

// Overall, this component provides a reusable text input field for setting the meeting name. It integrates with the Elastic UI library and potentially a custom ThemeSelector component to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface for managing meeting names in React applications.
