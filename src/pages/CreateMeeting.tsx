// The provided code is a React component named CreateMeeting. This component displays two cards using the Elastic UI (EUI) components. Each card represents a type of meeting that users can create. The component also includes the Header component and uses the useAuth custom hook.

// Let's go through the code:

import { EuiCard, EuiFlexGroup, EuiFlexItem, EuiImage } from "@elastic/eui";

import React from "react";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import meeting1 from "../assets/meeting1.png";
import meeting2 from "../assets/meeting2.png";

import Header from "../components/Header";
import useAuth from "../hooks/useAuth";

// The component imports various EUI components and React dependencies.

// It imports two images (meeting1 and meeting2) from the ../assets folder, which are used as icons for the cards.

// It imports the Header component from ../components/Header, which represents the application header.

// It imports the useAuth hook from ../hooks/useAuth, which is used to ensure that the user is authenticated before accessing the page.


export default function CreateMeeting() {
  useAuth();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
// Inside the CreateMeeting component, the useAuth hook is called to ensure the user is authenticated. It does this by calling the hook, which performs an authentication check using Firebase's onAuthStateChanged function.

// The navigate function from the react-router-dom library is obtained using the useNavigate hook to enable navigation to other pages.

{/* The component returns JSX elements, which create the layout for the page:

The Header component is rendered at the top of the page.

The page content is wrapped in a div with flexbox styles to align the content vertically.

Inside the EuiFlexGroup, there are two EuiFlexItem components, each representing a card: */}

          <EuiFlexItem>
            <EuiCard
              icon={<EuiImage src={meeting1} alt="icon" size="100%" />}
              title={`Create 1 on 1 Meeting`}
              description="Create a personal single person meeting."
              onClick={() => navigate("/create1on1")}
              paddingSize="xl"
            />
          </EuiFlexItem>
          <EuiFlexItem>
            <EuiCard
              icon={<EuiImage src={meeting2} alt="icon" size="100%" />}
              title={`Create Video Conference`}
              description="Invite multiple persons to the meeting."
              onClick={() => navigate("/videoconference")}
              paddingSize="xl"
            />
          </EuiFlexItem>
        </EuiFlexGroup>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

// The first card represents "Create 1 on 1 Meeting" and displays an image (meeting1) as an icon, a title, and a description.

// The second card represents "Create Video Conference" and displays a different image (meeting2) as an icon, a title, and a description.

// Both cards are clickable and use the onClick prop to navigate to different routes (/create1on1 and /videoconference) when clicked.


// Overall, the CreateMeeting component provides a simple user interface for creating different types of meetings in the application. The user is presented with two options: to create a one-on-one meeting or a video conference meeting, each represented by a card. When the user clicks on any of the cards, they will be redirected to the respective meeting creation page. The Header component ensures that the user is authenticated before accessing the page.
