// The code provided is setting up the Redux store using the @reduxjs/toolkit library. It configures the store with two reducers (authSlice.reducer and meetingsSlice.reducer) and exports types for RootState and AppDispatch to be used throughout the application.

// Here's an explanation of the code:


import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
// The code imports the configureStore function from @reduxjs/toolkit, which is a utility function that sets up the Redux store with some sensible defaults and optimizations.

import { authSlice } from "./slices/AuthSlice";
import { meetingsSlice } from "./slices/MeetingSlice";
// It imports the authSlice and meetingsSlice from their respective slice files. A slice in Redux Toolkit is a collection of Redux-related functionality for a specific part of the state. It includes reducer functions, action creators, and selectors.

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    auth: authSlice.reducer,
    meetings: meetingsSlice.reducer,
  },
});
// The store variable is created by calling configureStore, passing an object with the reducer property. The reducer object is used to combine all the reducers for different parts of the state. In this case, it combines the authSlice.reducer and meetingsSlice.reducer.



export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;

// The RootState type is exported using TypeScript's ReturnType utility type. It represents the type of the whole state managed by the Redux store and is automatically inferred based on the reducer configuration.

// The AppDispatch type is exported, representing the type of the Redux store's dispatch function. It is inferred from typeof store.dispatch, providing a type-safe way to dispatch actions.


// By exporting the store, RootState, and AppDispatch, other parts of the application can import and use them to interact with the Redux store, dispatch actions, and access the state. For example, a component can use the useSelector hook from react-redux to access the state and the useDispatch hook to dispatch actions.
