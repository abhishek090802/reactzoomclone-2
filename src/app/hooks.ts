// In this code, the useAppDispatch and useAppSelector hooks are created and exported for use in the React components. These hooks provide type-safe access to the Redux store's dispatch function and the application's state using react-redux hooks.

// Here's an explanation of the code:

import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { TypedUseSelectorHook } from "react-redux";
import { AppDispatch, RootState } from "./store";
export const useAppDispatch: () => AppDispatch = useDispatch;
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;

// The code imports the necessary hooks and types from react-redux and the RootState and AppDispatch types from the ./store file.

// The useAppDispatch hook is defined as a function that returns the AppDispatch type. It is created by calling the useDispatch hook from react-redux. This hook is used to get the Redux store's dispatch function, allowing components to dispatch actions.

// The useAppSelector hook is defined with the TypedUseSelectorHook type, which is a generic type provided by react-redux. It is used to type-safely access the application's state, based on the RootState type provided as a generic argument. This hook is created by calling the useSelector hook from react-redux, allowing components to select and read data from the Redux store's state.

// Both hooks, useAppDispatch and useAppSelector, are exported so that they can be used in other components throughout the application.

// Using these custom hooks, components can interact with the Redux store in a type-safe manner, ensuring that the data they access and actions they dispatch are properly typed and aligned with the application's state. For example, a component can use useAppSelector to select data from the store and useAppDispatch to dispatch actions with the correct types. This approach helps prevent common Redux-related errors and improves the overall developer experience.
