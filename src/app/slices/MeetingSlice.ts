// The code you provided defines a Redux slice for managing meeting-related state using the createSlice function from @reduxjs/toolkit. Let's recap the key points:


import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { ToastType } from "../../utils/types";

interface meetingInitialState {
  toasts: Array<ToastType>;
}
// An interface meetingInitialState is defined to represent the initial state of the meetings slice. It includes a toasts property, which is an array of ToastType.


const initialState: meetingInitialState = {
  toasts: [],
};
// The initialState constant is defined, setting the initial value of the meetings slice state. It includes an empty array for toasts.


export const meetingsSlice = createSlice({
  name: "meetings",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setToasts: (state, action) => {
      state.toasts = action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { setToasts } = meetingsSlice.actions;

// The createSlice function is used to create the Redux slice. It takes an object with the following properties:

// name: The name of the slice, used as a prefix for the action types.

// initialState: The initial state of the slice.

// reducers: An object that defines the reducer functions for handling actions. Each property of this object corresponds to an action type, and the corresponding value is the reducer function that updates the state based on the action payload.

// In this case, there is only one action defined called setToasts, which takes the state and action parameters. It sets the toasts array in the state to the payload of the action.

// The createSlice function generates action creators based on the reducers object. In this case, it will generate an action creator called setToasts, which can be used to dispatch the setToasts action with the appropriate payload.

// The generated action creators and reducer functions are automatically exported by the createSlice function.


// This Redux slice is now ready to be included in the Redux store by combining it with other slices using the combineReducers function, and then creating a store using the configureStore function. The action creator setToasts can be used in components to dispatch the setToasts action and update the toasts state in the Redux store.
