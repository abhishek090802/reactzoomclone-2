// The provided code is a custom React hook named useToast. It is used to manage toast messages in the application using Redux to store and display the toast messages.

// Let's summarize the functionality of this custom hook:


// The hook imports the necessary dependencies:

import { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from "../app/hooks";
import { setToasts } from "../app/slices/MeetingSlice";
// useAppDispatch and useAppSelector from ../app/hooks, which are custom hooks to access the app's dispatch function and state using useDispatch and useSelector from react-redux, respectively.

// setToasts action from the MeetingSlice (Redux slice) to update the Redux store with the toast messages.


function useToast() {
  const toasts = useAppSelector((zoom) => zoom.meetings.toasts);
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
  const createToast = ({
    title,
    type,
  }: {
    title: string;
    type: "success" | "primary" | "warning" | "danger" | undefined;
  }) => {
    dispatch(
      setToasts(
        toasts.concat({
          id: new Date().toISOString(),
          title,
          color: type,
        })
      )
    );
  };
// Inside the useToast hook, the toasts state variable and the dispatch function are obtained using useAppSelector and useAppDispatch, respectively. The toasts state variable represents an array of toast messages stored in the Redux store.


  return [createToast];
}

// The createToast function is defined within the hook. It takes an object with title and type properties as parameters. The title represents the content of the toast message, and the type represents the color or theme of the toast (e.g., "success," "warning," "danger," etc.).

// When createToast is called, it dispatches the setToasts action to update the toasts array in the Redux store. The new toast message is added to the existing array of toasts using the concat method. The new toast object contains an id generated from the current date and time, the title, and the color representing the type.

// The hook returns the createToast function as an element within an array. This allows components using the hook to call the createToast function to display toast messages.


export default useToast;

// Overall, this custom hook provides a convenient way to manage and display toast messages in the application. By using this hook, you can add new toast messages to the Redux store and have them displayed in a toast notification component. It helps to provide feedback and alerts to users for various actions and events in the application.
