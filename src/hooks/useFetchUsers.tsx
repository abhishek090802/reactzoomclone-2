// The provided code is a custom React hook named useFetchUsers. This hook is used to fetch a list of users from Firebase Firestore while excluding the current authenticated user from the list. The hook returns an array of users as a result of the query.

// Let's summarize the functionality of this custom hook:

// It imports necessary dependencies:

import { getDocs, query, where } from "firebase/firestore";
// getDocs, query, and where functions from firebase/firestore to interact with Firestore and perform queries.

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
// useEffect and useState from React to handle side effects and state management.

import { useAppSelector } from "../app/hooks";
// useAppSelector from the app/hooks file, which is a custom hook to access the app's state using useSelector.

import { usersRef } from "../utils/firebaseConfig";
// usersRef from ../utils/firebaseConfig, which is a reference to the Firestore collection containing user data.

import { UserType } from "../utils/types";
//  UserType from ../utils/types, which represents the type of a user object.



function useFetchUsers() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState<Array<UserType>>([]);
  const uid = useAppSelector((zoomApp) => zoomApp.auth.userInfo?.uid);
// Inside the useFetchUsers hook, a state variable users and a variable uid are declared using the useState and useAppSelector hooks, respectively.

  useEffect(() => {
    // The useEffect hook is used to fetch the list of users from Firestore when the uid changes. The uid represents the authenticated user's UID obtained from the app's state using useAppSelector.

    if (uid) {
      const getUser = async () => {
        const firestoreQuery = query(usersRef, where("uid", "!=", uid));
        const data = await getDocs(firestoreQuery);
        const firebaseUsers: Array<UserType> = [];

        data.forEach((user) => {
          const userData: UserType = user.data() as UserType;
          firebaseUsers.push({
            ...userData,
            label: userData.name,
          });
        });
        setUsers(firebaseUsers);
      };
      getUser();
    }
  }, [uid]);
  return [users];
}
//If uid is available (i.e., the user is authenticated), the hook executes an asynchronous function getUser to fetch the users.

// Within getUser, a Firestore query is created using the query and where functions to retrieve all users whose UID is not equal to the current authenticated user's UID (uid).

// The getDocs function is then called with the Firestore query to retrieve the user data.

// The data returned from the query is iterated using the forEach method, and each user's data is converted into the UserType object.

// The fetched user data is then added to the firebaseUsers array with an additional property label, which represents the user's name (used for display in the EuiComboBox component).

// Finally, the firebaseUsers array is set as the state using the setUsers function, and the fetched users are returned as the result of the hook.



export default useFetchUsers;

// Overall, this custom hook is designed to fetch a list of users from Firebase Firestore, excluding the current authenticated user. It can be utilized in various scenarios where you want to display a list of users for interaction or selection, such as inviting users to a meeting, sending messages, or any other functionality involving user data in the application.
